Explain briefly what is wrong with the following code with the help of a stack trace.

After researching the error for a bit I came accross a solution. 
This happens when you try to import a non-existing module, systemJS tries to load it from a URL.
If there are no related configuration, then it uses <CURRENT-HOST>/<MODULE-NAME>. When you look
at the network tab the response payload is HTML, but SystemJS tries to look at it as JavaScript 
and throws the error.
